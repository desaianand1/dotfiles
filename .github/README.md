# dotfiles
buncha .dotfiles, and setup automation to get a new macOS machine up and running with minimal manual labor

## The Shinies

- 💻 Terminal: kitty
- 🐚 Shell: zsh (& zgenom for some plugin management)
- ✍️ Font: JetBrains Nerd Font Mono (primarily; Fira Code Mono among others)
- 📝 Code Editor: Neovim and VSCode depending on the mood and language.
- 📝 Note Editor: Obsidian, rarely Typora.
- 🎨 Themes: Catppuccin Macchiato (rotate between Everforest Dark, Tokyo Night Storm, (Atom) One Dark Pro and Rose Pine Moon)
  I have themed damn near everything from kitty, neovim, firefox to Alfred, Discord, Spotify, Obsidian and even Bitwarden using these palettes
