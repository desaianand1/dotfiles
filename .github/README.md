# dotfiles
buncha .dotfiles, and setup automation to get a new macOS machine up and running with minimal manual labor

## Overview

- üíª Terminal: kitty
- üêö Shell: zsh (& zgenom for some plugin management)
- ‚úçÔ∏è Font: JetBrains Nerd Font Mono (primarily; Fira Code Mono, Mononoki among others)
- üìù Code Editor: Neovim or VSCode depending on the mood and language.
- üìù Note Editor: Obsidian, rarely Typora.
- üí¨ Prompt: p10k
- ü™ü Window Manager: Rectangle (@Apple how is this not a native feature)

## üé® Themes
- Catppuccin Macchiato (Primary)
- Everforest Dark
- Tokyo Night Storm
- (Atom) One Dark Pro
- Rose Pine Moon
- ... a few others I rotate through

I have themed damn near everything from kitty, Neovim, Firefox to Alfred, Discord, Spotify, Obsidian and even Bitwarden, zsh-fast-syntax-highlighting, k9s, fx and matplotlib using these palettes.
A lot of time sunk into adding pretty colors...

## Terminal niceties

> Listed in `.fresh_install/.brew-list`

- zoxide (aliased to `cd`): Makes it sooo convenient to jump around far directories without spamming `ls` to figure out paths or cycling zsh history. Great tool!
- fzf: Fuzzy search to find anything, anywhere with an intuitive terminal interface. Great for cherry picking.
- eza (aliased to `ls`): Makes traditional `ls` output prettier and more structured. Has neat metadata, NF icons, sorting options and flags.
- fx: interactive JSON viewer and processor. Powerful features to process and manipulate JSON or YAML files right in the terminal. Works great with `jq`
- k9s: Splendid Kubernetes client, right in your terminal. Free, OSS and themeable. Octant or Lens could never.
- tldr: provides brief `man` excerpts and usecases for my simple, monkey brain. Very useful for daunting commands.
- thefuck: aides my clumsy fingers. Auto-fixes broken commands or typos by executing the correct intention when you type `fuck`. Pretty carthatic at times.
- howdoi: solves those split-second "how do I exit vim again?" moments right in the terminal. Saves a trip to the browser/stackoverflow
- commitizen: interactive helper tool to create [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

## Mac apps & tools
> Some noteworthy Mac apps or menu bar tools that are useful for everyday tasks.

- Alfred: Spotlight replacement. The Old Guard. Still great!
